IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
WARNING








To reduce the risk of fire, electrical shock, or injury
when using your appliance, follow these basic precautions:

Read all instructions before using the appliance.
DANGER or WARNING: An empty beverage refrigerator can be a hazardous for children or small
pets. If disposing of the beverage refrigerator, remove gasket seals, latches, lids or the entire door from
your unused appliance, or take other action to ensure the beverage refrigerator is harmless.
Never allow children to operate, play with, or crawl inside the appliance.
Never clean appliance parts with flammable fluids or harsh chemicals. The fumes can create a fire hazard or explosion.
Do not store or use gasoline or any other flammable vapors and liquids in the vicinity of this or any other appliance. The fumes can create a fire hazard or explosion.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
BEFORE USING YOUR APPLIANCE
 Remove the exterior and interior packing.
 Before connecting the appliance to the power source, let it stand upright for approximately 4 hours. This
will reduce the possibility of a malfunction in the cooling system from handling during transportation.
 Clean the interior surface with lukewarm water using a soft cloth.

INSTALLATION OF YOUR APPLIANCE
 The appliance is designed for freestanding installation.
 WARNING: Do not store or install the appliance outdoors.
 CAUTION: This appliance is designed for storing and cooling beverage or wines. Do not store perishable
food, medicine or other medical products.
 Place your appliance on a hard and level floor that is strong enough to support it when it is fully loaded.
 To level your appliance, adjust the leveling legs at the bottom of the appliance if needed.
 Allowance of at least 5 inches (127mm) of space between the back and sides of the appliance are
suggested, which allows the proper air circulation to cool the compressor and condenser.
 We do not recommend installing the appliance on carpet.
 Do not install the appliance near an oven or other heating source. Direct sunlight may affect the acrylic
coating and heat sources may increase electrical consumption. For best performance, do not install the
appliance behind a cabinet door or block the base grille. Extreme cold ambient temperatures may also
cause the appliance not to perform properly.
 Avoid locating the appliance in area that may be exposed to excessive moisture.
 Plug in the appliance into an exclusive, grounded wall power outlet. Do not under any circumstances cut
or remove the third (ground) prong from the power cord. Any questions concerning power and/or grounding should be directed toward a qualified electrician or an authorized service center.

INSTALLATION LOCATION
Your beverage refrigerator should be conveniently located for day-to-day use in a dry, well-ventilated room.
Do not install the appliance where the temperature will go below 60°F or above 90°F, because it will not maintain proper temperatures. Be sure to install your beverage refrigerator on a floor strong enough to support it
when it is fully loaded.

Installation

FREESTANDING INSTALLATION
A freestanding installation will allow you to install the beverage refrigerator in any place you desire provided
that the required clearance space around the appliance is respected. In every setting, there must be an adequate ventilation and access for service. Never install or operate the unit in an enclosed area, such as a
closed cabinet. Allowance of at least 5 inches (127mm) of space between the back and sides of the appliance are suggested, which allows the proper air circulation to cool the compressor and condenser.

ELECTRICAL CONNECTION
WARNING: Improper use of the grounded plug can result in the risk of electrical shock. If the power
cord is damaged, have it replaced by a qualified electrician or contact Whynter Service Department.
This appliance requires a standard 115/120 Volt AC ~/60Hz electrical ground outlet with three-prong.
Have the wall outlet and circuit checked by a qualified electrician to make sure the outlet is properly
grounded. The cord should be secured behind the appliance and not left exposed or dangling to prevent
accidental injury.
The appliance should always be plugged into its own individual electrical outlet which has a voltage rating that matches the rating label on the appliance. This provides the best performance and also prevent
overloading house wiring circuits that could cause a fire hazard from overheated. Never unplug the appliance by pulling the power cord. Always grip the plug firmly and pull straight out from the receptacle.
Repair or replace immediately all power cords that have become frayed or otherwise damaged. Do not
use a cord that shows cracks or abrasion damage along its length or at either end. When moving the
appliance, be careful not to damage the power cord.

EXTENSION CORD
Because of potential safety hazards, it is strongly recommended that you do not use an extension cord
with this appliance. However, if you must use an extension cord, it is absolutely necessary that it be a
UL/CUL-Listed, 3-wire grounding type appliance extension cord having a grounding type plug and outlet
and that the electrical rating of the cord be 115 volts and at least 10 amperes.

9

Operation and Controls
It is recommended you install the appliance in a place where the ambient temperatures is above 60°F (16°C)
and below 90°F (32°C). If the ambient temperature is above or below recommended temperatures, the performance may be affected. For example, placing your appliance in extreme cold or hot conditions may cause
interior temperatures to fluctuate.

TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR BR-062WS
The temperature inside the beverage refrigerator is controlled by a thermostat control knob. The thermostat control box is located in the compressor compartment at
the back of the unit. To operate this control,
turn the thermostat control knob up or down to regulate the temperature inside the
beverage refrigerator. The
“0 – 5” number markings on control knob indicates the different temperature settings. Position “0” being the warmest and position “5” being the coldest.

TEMPERATURE CONTROL FOR BR-091WS / BR-128WS
To control the internal temperature, turn the temperature control dial inside
the appliance. The temperature range is from "0” to “7”, where “7” is the coldest temperature setting and “0” is the warmest temperature setting.
INTERIOR LIGHT (only available for BR-091WS / BR-128WS)
To turn on/ off the interior light, flip the switch inside the appliance.
INTERNAL FAN (only available for BR-091WS / BR-128WS)
This beverage refrigerator is equipped with an internal fan that prevents uneven temperature distribution, ensuring all of your beverage reaches your desired temperature .
PARTS:
1. Temperature Control
2. Light Switch
3. Interior Light
4. Internal Fan

REVERSING THE DOOR SWING

Operation and Controls

LEVELING THE APPLIANCE
It is important for the beverage refrigerator to be leveled in order to
work properly. It can be raised or lowered by rotating each of the
feet on the bottom of the machine. If you find that the surface is not
level, rotate the feet until the beverage refrigerator becomes level .You may need to make several adjustments to level it. We recommend using a carpenter’s level to check the machine.
1. Place a carpenter’s level on top of the product to see if the beverage refrigerator is level from front to back and side to side.
2. Adjust the height of the feet as follows: Turn the leveling feet to
the right to lower that side of the refrigerator. Turn the leveling feet to
the left to raise that side of the refrigerator.
IMPORTANT: Once you are ready to install, you must adjust the
feet to level the beverage refrigerator .

DEFROSTING
Under most ambient conditions, the appliance does not need to be defrosted. In cold ambient temperatures
and/or high humidity, some frost may build up. To defrost the appliance, set the thermostat dial to “0”, remove
frozen or perishable items and defrosting should occur in a few hours. After defrosting, return the thermostat
dial to the desired position. For faster defrosting, remove all items from the appliance, unplug the appliance
and leave the door open. Never use a knife or other metal instrument to scrape ice/frost from the evaporator.

NORMAL SOUNDS
The unit is cooled by a compressor. The compressor pumps coolant through the cooling system, producing
operating noise. Even when the compressor cuts out, noises caused by changes in temperature and pressure
are unavoidable. Operating noise will be most audible immediately after the compressor comes on. It becomes quieter as the operating period continues.
The following noises are normal and occur from time to time:
 Gurgling sound, caused by the refrigerant flowing through the appliance’s coils,
 Humming noise made by the compressor. This noise can get louder for brief periods when the motor is
switching on.
 Cracking/popping sounds, resulting from the materials contraction and expansion due to temperature variations,
 Fan operating sound, to circulate the air within the refrigerator cabinet.
 Unusual noise is normally the result of improper installation.
 Where the unit is installed in open-plan kitchen or in partition walls, the level of operating noise will be
heard more acutely. However, this is due to the surrounding architecture and not to the unit.

NOTE: An individual’s perception of noise is directly linked to the environment in which the unit is located, as well the specific type of models. Our appliances are in line with international standards for such appliance and in line with the latest technical developments. Please remember that the noise of the compressor
and the coolant circulating in the system is unavoidable.
