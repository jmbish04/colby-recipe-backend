IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS (continued)

WARNING

Safety Precautions

TO AVOID THE RISK OF SHOCK:

Glass Tray

DO NOT remove top or outer panel
from oven. Repairs must be done
only by a qualified service person.

1. DO NOT operate the oven without the Roller Ring and the Glass
Tray in place.
2. DO NOT operate the oven without the Glass Tray fully engaged
on the drive hub. Improper cooking or damage to the oven
could result. Verify that the Glass Tray is properly engaged and
rotating by observing its rotation when you press Start.
Note: The Glass Tray can turn in either direction.

TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO MICROWAVE ENERGY:
DO NOT tamper with, or make any adjustments or repairs to Door,
Control Panel Frame, Safety Interlock Switches, or any other part of
the oven. Microwave leakage may result.

3. Use only the Glass Tray specifically designed for this oven.
DO NOT substitute any other Glass Tray.

TO AVOID THE RISK OF ARCING DAMAGE OR FIRE:

5. DO NOT cook directly on the Glass Tray. Always place food in
a microwave safe dish, or on a rack set in a microwave safe dish.

4. If the Glass Tray is hot, allow to cool before cleaning or placing
in water.

1. DO NOT operate the microwave
oven empty, cook small food
portions unattended, or use
metal containers. When using the
microwave oven without water or
food, or cook too small a serving,
microwave energy cannot be
absorbed and will continuously
reflect throughout the cavity. This will cause arcing and damage
the oven cavity, door or other components.

6. If food or utensil on the Glass Tray touches oven walls, causing
the tray to stop moving, the tray will automatically rotate in the
opposite direction.

Roller Ring
1. The Roller Ring and oven floor should be cleaned frequently to
prevent excessive noise.

2. DO NOT store flammable materials next
to, on top of, or in the oven.

2. Always replace the Roller Ring and the Glass Tray in their proper
positions.

3. DO NOT dry clothes, newspapers or other
materials in the oven, or use newspaper or
paper bags for cooking.

3. The Roller Ring must always be used for cooking along with the
Glass Tray.

4. DO NOT hit or strike Control Panel.
Damage to controls may occur.
5. DO NOT use recycled paper products unless the paper product
is labeled as safe for microwave oven use. Recycled paper
products may contain impurities, which may cause sparking.

TO AVOID THE RISK OF SCALDING AND BURNING:
POT HOLDERS should always be
used when removing items from
the oven. Heat is transferred from
the HOT food to the cooking
container and from the container
to the Glass Tray. The Glass
Tray can also be very HOT after
removing the cooking container from the oven. The wire rack is
designed for use in the Convection, Broil, Airfry and Combo modes,
and will be hot after use.
Care in handling the Wire Rack, Enamel Tray and Airfry Basket
must be exercised.

Food Preparation
Follow these Safety Precautions when cooking in your oven.
IMPORTANT
Proper cooking depends upon the power, the time setting
and quantity of food. If you use a smaller portion than
recommended but cook at the time for the recommended
portion, fire could result.

4) FOODS WITH NONPOROUS SKINS
• DO NOT COOK / REHEAT WHOLE EGGS, WITH OR WITHOUT
THE SHELL.
Steam buildup in whole
eggs may cause them to
explode, and possibly
damage the oven or
cause injury. Reheating
SLICED hard-boiled eggs
and cooking SCRAMBLED eggs is safe.
• Potatoes, apples, whole squash and
sausages are examples of foods with
nonporous skins. These types of foods
must be pierced before microwave
cooking to prevent them from
exploding.
CAUTION: Cooking dry or old
potatoes can cause fire.

1) HOME CANNING / STERILIZING / DRYING FOODS / SMALL
QUANTITIES OF FOODS
• DO NOT use your oven for home canning. Your oven cannot
maintain the food at the proper canning temperature. The food
may be contaminated and then spoil.
• DO NOT use the microwave oven to sterilize objects (baby
bottles, etc.). It is difficult to keep the oven at the high
temperature needed for sterilization.
• DO NOT dry meats, herbs, fruits or vegetables in your oven.
Small quantities of food or foods with low moisture content can
dry out, scorch or catch on fire if overheated.
• DO NOT prepare small food portions at high power. This can
cause energy concentration at a fixed spot, which can lead to
arcing and damage to your oven. Select a lower cook power
setting when preparing small portions.

5) GLASS TRAY / COOKING CONTAINERS / FOIL
• Cooking containers get hot during microwaving. Heat is
transferred from the HOT food to the container and the Glass
Tray. Use pot holders when removing containers from the oven
or when removing lids or plastic wrap covers from cooking
containers, to avoid burns.
• The Glass Tray will get hot during cooking. It should be allowed
to cool before handling or before paper products, such as paper
plates or microwave popcorn bags, are placed in the oven for
microwave cooking.
• When using foil in the oven, allow at least 1-inch (2.5 cm) of
space between foil and interior oven walls or door.
• Dishes with metallic trim should not be used, as arcing
may occur.

2) POPCORN
Popcorn may be popped in a microwave oven corn popper.
Microwave popcorn that pops in its own package is also
available. Follow popcorn manufacturers’ directions and use a
brand suitable for the cooking power of your microwave oven.
CAUTION: When using pre-packaged microwave popcorn,
you can follow recommended package instructions or use the
Popcorn menu (refer to page 34). Otherwise, the popcorn may
not pop adequately or may ignite and cause a fire. Never leave
the oven unattended when popping popcorn. Allow the popcorn
bag to cool before opening, and always open the bag facing
away from your face and body to prevent steam burns.

6) PAPER TOWELS / CLOTHS
• DO NOT use paper towels or cloths that contain a synthetic fiber
woven into them. The synthetic fiber may cause the towel to
ignite. Use paper toweling under supervision.

7) BROWNING DISHES / OVEN COOKING BAGS
• Browning dishes or grills are designed for microwave cooking
only. Always follow instructions provided by the manufacturer.
DO NOT preheat browning dish more
than six minutes.
• If an oven cooking bag is used for
microwave cooking, prepare according to
package directions. DO NOT use a wire
twist-tie to close bag. Instead use plastic
ties, cotton string or a strip cut from the
open end of the bag.

3) DEEP FAT FRYING
• DO NOT deep fat fry in your microwave oven. Cooking oils
may burst into flames and may cause damage to the oven and
may result in burns. Microwave utensils may not withstand the
temperature of the hot oil, and can shatter or melt.

7

F0003CD60AP_EN_0303.indd 7

2020/3/3 9:58:10

Food Preparation (continued)
8) THERMOMETERS
• DO NOT use a conventional
meat thermometer in your
oven. Arcing may occur.
Microwave safe thermometers
are available for both meat and
candy.

12) HEATER OPERATION
• Exterior oven surfaces, including air vents on the cabinet and
the oven door will get hot during Airfry, Convection, Combo
or Broil functions. To prevent burns, take care when opening
or closing the door and when inserting or removing food and
accessories.
• The oven has heaters situated in the top of the oven. During
and after using either the Airfry, Convection, Combo or Broil
functions, all inside surfaces of the oven will be very hot. To
prevent burns, care should be taken to avoid touching the
inside surfaces of the oven.
• TO AVOID THE RISK OF SCALDING, please use caution when
touching accessible parts when oven is operated in Convection,
Combo or Broil mode, because the accessible parts may
become extremely hot.

9) BABY FORMULA / BABY FOOD
• DO NOT heat baby formula or baby
food in the microwave oven. The glass
jar or surface of the food may appear
warm while the interior can be so
hot as to burn the infant’s mouth and
esophagus.

13) BEFORE USING YOUR OVEN
• Before using the oven for the first time, wipe excessive oil off
in the oven cavity and operate the oven without food and
accessories on Convection at 425 °F (220 °C), for 10 minutes.
This will allow the oil that is used for rust protection to be
burned off. This is the only time the oven is used empty.
(with the exception of preheating on Convection.)

10) REHEATING PASTRY PRODUCTS
• When reheating pastry products, check temperatures of any
fillings before eating. Some foods have fillings, which heat
faster and can be extremely hot, while the surface remains
warm to the touch (for example, jelly donuts).
11) GENERAL OVEN USAGE GUIDELINES
• DO NOT use the oven for any purpose other than the
preparation of food. This oven is specifically designed to heat
or cook food. DO NOT use this oven to heat chemicals or other
non-food products.
• Before use, check that utensils/containers are suitable for use in
microwave ovens.
• DO NOT attempt to use this microwave oven to dry newspaper,
clothing or any other materials. They may catch fire.
• When the oven is not being used, DO NOT store any objects
other than oven accessories inside the oven in case it is
accidentally turned on.
• The appliance shall not be operated by Microwave or Combo
WITHOUT FOOD IN THE OVEN.
Operation in this manner may damage the appliance.
• If smoke or a fire occurs in the oven, press the Stop/Reset button
and leave the door closed in order to extinguish the flames.
Disconnect the power cord, or shut off power at the fuse.
• Extreme caution must be used when moving hot liquids.
• When handling cooking containers take care not to let the
contents spill.
• Avoid hot steam, serious burns and scalds could result.
• To prevent injury, do not allow anyone to lean, hang, sit or
place heavy items on the open door of the appliance.
Severe personal injury could result.
• Do not use a steam cleaner to clean this appliance. The steam
from the cleaning appliance could penetrate live components
and permanently damage the oven or cause injury.
• The use of accessories not recommended by Panasonic may
cause injury.

Convection Bake
The oven can be used as a
conventional oven using the
Convection mode which
incorporates a heating element
with a fan. There is a choice of
Convection temperatures 100 °F
(40 °C) and 215 °F (100 °C) - 425 °F
(220 °C). For quick selection of the
most commonly used cooking
temperatures, the oven starts at
300 °F (150 °C) and then for each
press the temperature will count
up in 18 °F (10 °C) stages to 425 °F
(220 °C), then to, 100 °F (40 °C),
215 °F (100 °C), 230 °F (110 °C) etc.
This feature provides 2 modes to

Sensor Reheat
(One Push Reheating)
Program
This unique feature ‘the
Genius’ built-in sensor allows
you to reheat a chilled meal
with one push of the dial. It
is not necessary to select the
power level or cooking time.
The built-in sensor measures
the humidity of the food and
calculates the cooking time.

Sensor Reheat

Weight

8 - 36 oz.
(200 - 1000 g)

Accessories

Instructions
All foods must be pre-cooked. Foods
should be at refrigerator temperature approx. 41 °F (+ 5 °C). Reheat in
microwaveable container as purchased.
If transferring food to dish, cover with
pierced plastic wrap. Press dial to Start.
Stir at beeps. Stir again at end of program and allow a few minutes standing
time. Large pieces of meat/fish in a thin
sauce may require longer cooking.

One Push Reheating food chart:
Suitable foods

Unsuitable foods

ヴㄕ㄂ㄓㄕバヴㄆㄍㄆ㄄ㄕ

Pre-Cooked Dishes: Casserole, Stew, Leftover
Chilled Meal, Entrée
Raw Foods: Vegetables, Meats, Rice
Thicker Foods, cannot not be stirred: Lasagne, Shepherds Pie
Beverages: Water, Milk, Coffee

How it works
Once the One Push Reheating has been selected, the food is heated up. As food begins to get hot,
steam is emitted. When the food reaches a certain temperature and begins to cook, an even greater
amount of steam is released. The increase in steam emission is detected by a humidity sensor in
the oven. This acts as a signal for the oven to calculate how much longer the food needs to cook.
The remaining cooking time will appear in the display window after two beeps. Whilst the Sensor
symbol is still flashing in the display window the oven door should not be opened. Wait until the
cooking time appears in the window, and then open the door if required, to stir or turn the food.

ヴㄆㄏㄔㄐㄓチンㄆㄉㄆ㄂ㄕ

When clock mode is displayed,
press the dial to Start. To reset
oven and return to clock mode,
press Stop/Reset twice.

Adjust to Taste
The One Push Reheating reheats a chilled meal for average tastes. You are able to adjust the
reheating program to your own taste. After pressing Start, +/- symbol and flashing bar appears in
the display, turn dial clockwise for more time or anticlockwise for less time. This operation should be
completed within 14 seconds. Default mode is normal.

Notes:
1. Press the dial in two minutes right after the door was closed, otherwise One Push Reheating
Function will be rejected and beeps will sound. Open the door and close it again will release
the One Push Reheating Function.
2. The oven automatically calculates the reheating time or the remaining reheating time.
3. The door should not be opened before the time appears in the display window.
4. To prevent any mistakes during One Push Reheating ensure that glass tray and the container
are dry.
5. The room temperature should not be more than 95 °F (35 °C) and not less than 32 °F (0 °C).
6. If the oven has previously been used and it is too hot to be used on One Push Reheating, “HOT INSIDE
WAIT” will appear in the display window. After the “HOT INSIDE WAIT” disappears, the One Push
Reheating may be used. If in a hurry, cook food manually by selecting the correct cooking mode and
cooking time yourself.

fish by weight. The oven will determine the defrosting time and
power levels. Once the oven is programmed, the defrosting
time will appear in the display. For best results the minimum
recommended weight is 0.1 lb (0.1 kg).
2. Turn over the food, remove defrosted food and shield thin
ends/fat bones of roast with foil when buzzer rings in the
middle of cooking.

NOTES:
1. If desires, More/Less adjustment can be done. Turn dial to
add or subtract the cooking time (3 levels can be select), after
turning the dial within 14 seconds.
2. After having used the Sensor Cook feature a few times, you
may decide you would prefer your food cooked to a different
doneness – that is why you would like to turning the dial.
3. When steam is detected by the Genius Sensor and two beeps
sound, the remaining cooking time will appear in the display.
4. Automatic features are provided for your convenience. If
results are not suitable to your individual preference, or if
serving size is other than what is listed in next page, please
refer to manual cooking on page 25.
5. If the temperature of the cavity is too high, Sensor Cook feature
cannot be used. The message “HOT INSIDE WAIT” will appears
in the display window. Sensor Cook feature can be used again
when the “HOT INSIDE WAIT” message disappears. Please open
the door in order to cool the temperature of the cavity more
quickly.

For the best results with the GENIUS SENSOR, follow these
recommendations:
BEFORE Reheating/Cooking:
1. The room temperature surrounding the oven should be below
95 °F (35 °C).
2. Food weight should exceed 4 oz. (110 g).
3. Be sure the glass tray, the outside of the cooking containers
and the inside of the microwave oven are dry before placing
food in the oven. Residual beads of moisture turning into
steam can mislead the sensor.
4. Cover food with lid, or with vented plastic wrap. Never use
tightly sealed plastic containers—they can prevent steam from
escaping and cause food to overcook.
DURING Reheating/Cooking:
DO NOT open the oven door until two beeps sound and cooking time
appears in the display. Doing so will cause inaccurate cooking since
the steam from food is no longer contained within the oven cavity.
Once the cooking time begins to count down, the oven door may
be opened to stir, turn or rearrange foods.
AFTER Reheating/Cooking:
All foods should have a standing time.

Defrosting Tips & Techniques
After Defrosting:
1. Large items may be icy in the center. Defrosting will complete
during Standing Time.
2. Let stand, covered, following standing time directions on page 28.
3. Rinse foods indicated in the chart.
4. Items which have been layered should be rinsed separately or
have a longer standing time.

Preparation For Freezing:
1. Freeze meats, poultry, and fish in packages with only one or two
layers of food. Place wax paper between layers.
2. Package in heavy-duty plastic wraps, bags (labeled “For Freezer”),
or freezer paper.
3. Remove as much air as possible.
4. Seal securely, date, and label.
To Defrost:
1. Remove wrapper. This helps moisture to evaporate. Juices from
food can get hot and cook the food.
2. Set food in microwave safe dish.
3. Place roasts fat-side down. Place whole poultry breast-side down.
4. Select power and minimum time so that items will be underdefrosted.
5. Drain liquids during defrosting.
6. Turn over (invert) items during defrosting.

Food Characteristics
Bone and Fat

Shape

Both bone and fat affect cooking. Bones may cause irregular cooking.
Meat next to the tips of bones may overcook while meat positioned under
a large bone, such as a ham bone, may be undercooked. Large amounts
of fat absorb microwave energy and the meat next to these areas may
overcook.

Uniform sizes heat more evenly. The thin end of a drumstick will cook
more quickly than the meaty end. To compensate for irregular shapes,
place thin parts toward the center of the dish and thick pieces toward the
edge.

Size
Thin pieces cook more quickly than thick pieces.

Density
Porous, airy foods such as breads, cakes or rolls take less time to cook
than heavy, dense foods such as potatoes and roasts. When reheating
donuts or other foods with different centers be very careful. Certain foods
have centers made with sugar, water, or fat and these centers attract
microwaves (for example, jelly donuts). When a jelly donut is heated,
the jelly can become extremely hot while the exterior remains warm to
the touch. This could result in a burn if the food is not allowed to cool
properly in the center.

Starting Temperature
Foods that are at room temperature take less time to cook than if they are
chilled, refrigerated or frozen.

Quantity
Two potatoes take longer to cook than one potato. As the quantity of
the food decreases so does the cooking time. Overcooking will cause the
moisture content in the food to decrease and a fire could result. Never
leave microwave unattended while in use.

51

F0003CD60AP_EN_0303.indd 51

2020/3/3 9:58:23

Cooking Techniques
Piercing

Standing Time

Foods with skins or membranes must be pierced, scored or have a strip of
skin peeled before cooking to allow steam to escape. Pierce clams, oysters,
chicken livers, whole potatoes and whole vegetables. Whole apples or new
potatoes should have a 1-inch (2.5 cm) strip of skin peeled before cooking.
Score sausages and frankfurters. Do not Cook/Reheat whole eggs, with or
without the shell. Steam buildup in whole eggs may cause them to explode,
and possibly damage the oven or cause injury. Reheating SLICED hard-boiled
eggs and cooking SCRAMBLED eggs is safe.

Most foods will continue to cook by conduction after the microwave oven
is turned off. After cooking meat, the internal temperature will rise 5 °F to
15 °F (3 °C to 8 °C), if allowed to stand, tented with foil, for 10 to 15 minutes.
Casseroles and vegetables need a shorter amount of standing time, but this
standing time is necessary to allow foods to complete cooking to the center
without overcooking on the edges.

Browning

Test for Doneness

Foods will not have the same brown appearance as conventionally cooked foods
or those foods which are cooked utilizing a browning feature. Meats and poultry
may be coated with browning sauce, Worcestershire sauce, barbecue sauce or
shake-on browning sauce. To use, combine browning sauce with melted butter
or margarine and brush on before cooking. For quick breads or muffins, brown
sugar can be used in the recipe in place of granulated sugar, or the surface can be
sprinkled with dark spices before baking.

The same tests for doneness used in conventional cooking may be used for
microwave cooking. Meat is done when fork-tender or splits at fibers. Chicken
is done when juices are clear yellow and drumstick moves freely. Fish is done
when it flakes and is opaque. Cake is done when a toothpick or cake tester is
inserted and comes out clean.

Spacing

Check foods to see that they are cooked to the United States Department
of Agriculture’s recommended temperatures.
To test for doneness, insert a meat thermometer in a thick or dense area
away from fat or bone. NEVER leave the thermometer in the food during
cooking, unless it is approved for microwave oven use.

Individual foods, such as baked potatoes, cupcakes and appetizers, will cook
more evenly if placed in the oven equal distances apart. When possible,
arrange foods in a circular pattern.

Covering
As with conventional cooking, moisture evaporates during microwave
cooking. Casserole lids or plastic wrap are used for a tighter seal. When using
plastic wrap, vent the plastic wrap by folding back part of the plastic wrap
from the edge of the dish to allow steam to escape. Loosen or remove plastic
wrap as recipe directs for standing time. When removing plastic wrap covers,
as well as any glass lids, be careful to remove them away from you to avoid
steam burns. Various degrees of moisture retention are also obtained by
using wax paper or paper towels.

Cook all food to these minimum internal temperatures as measured
with a food thermometer before removing food from oven. For
reasons of personal preference, you may choose to cook food at
higher temperatures.

Product
Beef, Pork, Veal & Lamb
Steaks, chops, roasts
Ground meats
Ham, fresh or smoked
(uncooked)

Shielding
Thin areas of meat and poultry cook more quickly than meaty portions.
To prevent overcooking, these thin areas can be shielded with strips of
aluminum foil. Wooden toothpicks may be used to hold the foil in place.
CAUTION is to be exercised when using foil. Arcing can occur if foil is too
close to oven wall or door and damage to your oven will result.

Cooking times will vary because of food shape variations, starting
temperature, and regional preferences. Always cook food for the minimum
cooking time given in a recipe and check for doneness. If the food is
undercooked, continue cooking. It is easier to add time to an undercooked
product. Once the food is overcooked, nothing can be done.

All Poultry (breasts, whole
bird, legs, thighs, and wings,
ground poultry, and stuffing)
Eggs
Fish & Shellfish
Leftovers
Casseroles

Stirring
Stirring is usually necessary during microwave cooking. Always bring the
cooked outside edges toward the center and the less cooked center portions
toward the outside of the dish.

Rearranging
Rearrange small items such as chicken pieces, shrimp, hamburger patties or
pork chops. Rearrange pieces from the edge to the center and pieces from
the center to the edge of the dish.

Turning
It is not possible to stir some foods to distribute the heat evenly. At times,
microwave energy will concentrate in one area of the food. To help ensure
even cooking, these foods need to be turned. Turn over large foods, such as
roasts or turkeys, halfway through cooking.

Care and Cleaning of Your Microwave Oven
Please see below and the following page for
particular cleaning instructions for each section of
the oven.


 
 
BEFORE CLEANING: Unplug oven at wall outlet. If outlet
is inaccessible, leave oven door open while cleaning.
AFTER CLEANING: Be sure to place the Roller Ring and
the Glass Tray in the proper position and press Stop/
Reset Button to clear the Display.
1. Outside oven surfaces: Clean with a damp cloth.

To prevent damage to the operating parts inside
the oven, water should not be allowed to seep into
ventilation openings.
2. Label: Do not remove. Wipe with a damp cloth.
3. Inside the Oven: Wipe with a damp cloth after
using. Mild detergent may be used if needed. Do not
use harsh detergents or abrasives.
4. Oven Door: Wipe with a soft dry cloth when steam
accumulates inside or around the outside of the
      
oven door. During cooking, especially under high
humidity conditions, steam is given off from the
food. (Some steam will condense on cooler surfaces, such as the oven door. This is normal.) Inside surface is covered with a heat and
vapor barrier film. Do not remove.
5. Oven Cavity Floor: Clean the bottom surface of the oven with mild detergent, water or window cleaner, and dry.
6. Waveguide Cover: Do not remove Waveguide Cover. It is important to keep cover clean in the same manner as the inside of
the oven. Failure to do so may damage the cover.
7. Control Panel: If the Control Panel becomes wet, clean it with a soft dry cloth. Do not use harsh detergents or abrasives.
For some models: The Control Panel is covered with a removable protective film to prevent scratches during shipping. Small bubbles
may appear under this film, so if this is the case, remove by applying masking or clear tape to an exposed corner and pull gently.
8. Glass Tray: Remove and wash in warm soapy water or in a dishwasher.
9. Roller Ring: Roller Ring may be washed in mild soapy water or dishwasher. These areas should be kept clean to avoid excessive noise.
AS WITH ANY COOKING APPLIANCE, MICROWAVE OVENS REQUIRE THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE TO PREVENT OVERHEATING OR
DAMAGE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE OVEN CLEAN AND DRY. FOOD RESIDUE AND CONDENSATION MAY CAUSE
RUSTING OR ARCING AND DAMAGE TO THE OVEN. AFTER USE, WIPE DRY ALL SURFACES,
INCLUDING VENT OPENINGS, OVEN SEAMS, AND UNDER GLASS TRAY.

NOTES:
1.
2.

After cooking, the oven should be cleaned with a soft cloth moistened with soapy water. If the oven is not cleaned occasionally to
eliminate grease, it can accumulate and cause the oven to “Smoke” during use.
DO NOT SPRAY DIRECTLY INSIDE THE OVEN.
A steam cleaner is not to be used for cleaning.

Before Requesting Service
See below before calling for service, as most problems can easily be remedied by following these simple solutions:
Problem

Solution

The oven causes TV
interference.

Some radio, TV, Wi-Fi, cordless telephone, baby monitor, blue tooth or
other wireless equipment interference might occur when you cook with the
microwave oven. This interference is similar to the interference caused by small
appliances such as mixers, vacuums, blow dryers, etc. It does not indicate a
problem with your oven.

Steam accumulates
on oven door and
warm air comes from
the oven vents.

During cooking, steam and warm air are given off from the food. Most of the
steam and warm air are removed from the oven by the air which circulates in the
oven cavity. However, some steam will condense on cooler surfaces such as the
oven door. This is normal. After use, the oven should be wiped dry (see page 53).

Smoke and burnt
smell will occur after
the first use.

This is not a malfunction and will go away after a few uses.
The oven is not plugged in securely or needs to be reset; remove plug from
outlet, wait ten seconds and re-insert.

Oven will not turn on.

Main circuit breaker or main fuse is tripped or blown. Reset main circuit breaker
or replace main fuse.
There is a problem with the outlet; plug another appliance into the outlet to
check if it is working.
The door is not closed completely. Close the oven door securely.
Start was not pressed after programming; Press dial to Start.

Oven will not start
cooking.

Another program is already entered into the oven; press Stop/Reset to cancel
the previous program and enter new program.
The program is not correct; program again according to the Owner’s manual.
Stop/Reset has been pressed accidentally; program oven again.

The Glass Tray
wobbles.

The Glass Tray is not positioned properly on the Roller Ring or there is food under
the Roller Ring. Take out Glass Tray and Roller Ring. Wipe with a damp cloth and
reset Roller Ring and Glass Tray properly..

When the oven is
operating, there is
noise coming from
the Glass Tray.

The Roller Ring and oven bottom are dirty; clean these parts according to Care
and Cleaning of Your Microwave Oven (see page 53).
